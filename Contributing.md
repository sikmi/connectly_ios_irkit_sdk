Contributing
============

I love receiving a pull request.  
Here's a quick guide.

1. Fork the repo.
1. Create a branch from master with a descriptive name.
1. Push.
1. Send a pull request!

If you've contributed more than a few lines of code, use [Uncrustify](http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/) with this configuration file [.uncrustifyconfig](.uncrustifyconfig).  
I recommend using [BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode](https://github.com/benoitsan/BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode)
